# RPN in OCaml 

This OCaml project reads in an input such as "1 1 +" and evaluates it using Reverse Polish Notation. 

It reads a single line each run and output the result or error on a new line.

As far as I'm aware, all RPN statements should work. It should also catch potential errors.

## Usage

To compile the RPN, run the following:

```bash
ocamlfind ocamlc -o RPN -package str -linkpkg -g rpn.ml
```

Then run it with:

```bash
./RPN
```

You will then be prompted to enter input such as:

```bash
1 1 +
```

Then press enter to see the output.

### Unit Tests

There is a set of test cases provided in the `test.txt` and `result.txt` files. They have all been added to the `test.ml` file for quick testing.

To compile the unit test, run the following:

```bash
ocamlfind ocamlc -o Test -package str -package oUnit -linkpkg -g rpn.ml test.ml
```

Then run it with:

```bash
./Test
```

**Note** It seems the `rpn.ml` code runs before the test cases, so press enter once to see an input error generated by `rpn.ml` and the the test results from `test.ml`
